            <h3>Playing Video Games</h3>
            <p>I really enjoy playing video games. I find it fun and engaging to delve into fantasy worlds where my 
                my choices can make such an important impact on the story and the world. For the purposes of this
                assignment, I'm not sure what else to say about that, so I've asked ChatGPT to write an article about
                about why we find video games so engaging:

                <h4>The Engaging Nature of Video Games</h4>
                <p>Video games captivate millions worldwide, but what makes them so engaging? They offer immersive 
                    experiences through interactive gameplay and storytelling, allowing players to escape reality and 
                    assume new roles. Additionally, they provide challenges and rewards, fueling motivation and a sense
                    of accomplishment. Social features enable connections with others, fostering camaraderie and 
                    competition. Technological advancements enhance sensory experiences, drawing players deeper into 
                    virtual worlds. In essence, the allure of video games lies in their immersive storytelling, 
                    challenges, social interactions, and sensory stimulation, shaping the future of entertainment.</p>

            <h3>Making Video Games</h3>
            <p>I also really enjoy developing video games! Frankly, it's been a little bit, because it can be a big time
                commitment, and other life obligations can get in the way, you know? A couple of years ago, I did publish 
                a mobile game called "<a href="https://www.errorloadingmedia.com/">Spooky Street</a>"" that you can 
                download in the App Store or on Google Play! Someday soon I hope to publish another game. Okay, well, 
                I'll talk to you later!
